I'll update the README to reflect that your frontend directory is named "onebank-frontend" instead of just "frontend":

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm

## Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucey-star/OneBank.git
cd OneBank/Backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment
- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the backend server
```bash
python run.py
```

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
```bash
cd ../onebank-frontend
```

2. Install npm dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the React application
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Start  the frontend
```bash
npm start
```

The server will serve the frontend application and properly handle all routes, ensuring that navigation to pages like `/login` and `/signup` works correctly.

## Browser Plugin Setup

The browser plugin is developed for Chrome. To install:
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the plugin directory

## Configuration

- Ensure you have the necessary API keys (e.g., OpenAI) configured in your environment variables
- Update database configurations in the backend settings
- Make sure your CORS settings in the backend allow requests from your frontend domain

## Frontend Server Details

The frontend is served using a Node.js Express server that handles all routes and redirects them to the React application. This ensures that directly accessing routes like `/signup` will work properly instead of resulting in 404 errors.

The server.js file contains a simple Express configuration that:
- Serves static files from the build directory
- Redirects all routes to the React application's index.html
- Handles proper routing for single-page applications

## Future Roadmap

- Implement recommendation history
- Enhance physical card functionality
- Improve browser plugin features

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Express.js (for serving the frontend)
- Backend: Flask
- Database: 
  - development: SQLite
  - production: postgreSQL
- Browser Plugin: JavaScript, Chrome Extension API
